<h1>Decision Tree Classifier based on Entropy and Information Gain </h1>

This Decision Tree Classifier is implemented using the Car Evaluation Dataset, which classifies cars based on features like buying price, maintenance cost, doors, persons, lug_boot, and safety. The model utilizes Entropy and Information Gain for splitting criteria, rather than the traditional Gini Index, and follows a binary tree structure. Key features include visualizing the decision tree, verifying predictions using test data, and displaying the full training dataset or specific rows for inspection.

Features:
1.Print Decision Tree: Visualize the decision tree with split conditions.
2.Verify Predictions: Evaluate the model using test data.
3.Show Training Data Table: Display the complete training dataset.
4.Show Specific Row: Retrieve any row from the training data.
5.Count Unique Attributes: Count unique values for each feature.
6.Calculate Information Gain: Compute Information Gain for each feature.
7.Calculate Entropy: Measure the impurity of data using Entropy.
8.Clear Screen: Clear the console for better navigation.
9.Change Training File: Switch to a different training dataset.
